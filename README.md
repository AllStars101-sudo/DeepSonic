# DeepSonic
DeepSonic is a fully open source Deep Learning music experiment that is capable of synthesizing, generating, remixing, modifying music, all using the power of AI. Thanks to powerful open-source libraries such as Magenta by Tensorflow/Google and Jukebox by OpenAI, we were able to create a multi-functional AI Audio Engineer.
